# First entry
Today was one of those brisk but sunny early spring days. I woke up early, took a short walk around the neighborhood, and enjoyed seeing the crocuses just beginning to bloom. Work was mostly uneventful—a couple of video calls and a bit of coding on the project I’m leading. In the afternoon, I took a break and went to a café downtown for an oat milk latte. The place was busy but not too loud. In the evening, I cooked pasta with tomato sauce and finished the latest episode of my favorite podcast.

# Second entry
The rain came down hard all day. I had planned to run errands but ended up staying inside. Spent most of the afternoon reading a mystery novel—completely lost track of time. At lunch, I made a big pot of vegetable soup and watched the rain streak down the kitchen window. I also FaceTimed with my sister for about an hour, which really cheered me up. Ended the day practicing a few songs on my guitar.

# Third entry
Woke up to clear skies and mild temperatures, so I decided to go for a longer bike ride along the river. There were lots of people out enjoying the weather—some families having picnics, others just relaxing. Afterward, I grabbed a sandwich at my favorite deli and ate it in the park. Spent the afternoon working remotely from home, focused on debugging an issue with our deployment pipeline. Watched a new documentary about space exploration before bed.

# Fourth entry
Today felt slow and peaceful. I slept in, made pancakes for breakfast, and listened to an old jazz playlist. The weather was grey but dry, so in the late morning I took a detour through the botanical gardens—saw some early daffodils and even a rabbit darting through the hedges. Most of the afternoon was spent meal prepping for the week and catching up on laundry. Called my parents in the evening to see how their trip was going.

# Fifth entry
It finally warmed up! The afternoon reached nearly 18°C. I worked from a bench outside for a while, enjoying the sunshine while answering emails and writing documentation for a new feature. For lunch, I got takeout bao buns from a new place in the neighborhood—they were delicious. After work, I met a friend for a walk around the lake, and we made plans to try paddleboarding next weekend. Felt re-energized after so much fresh air.
